# Publish to PyPI when a GitHub Release is created
#
# Setup:
# 1. Create a PyPI account at https://pypi.org
# 2. Create an API token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/
# 3. Add the token as a GitHub secret named PYPI_API_TOKEN
#    (Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret)
#
# Usage:
# 1. Update version in pyproject.toml (e.g., 0.1.0 → 0.2.0)
# 2. Commit and push
# 3. Go to GitHub → Releases → Create a new release
# 4. Tag: v0.2.0 (match pyproject.toml version)
# 5. Publish release → This workflow runs automatically
